# User Journey Testing

## Background

We have an alpha version of a new product. Some key user journeys are taking
shape and we want to make sure that appropriate test coverage is in place. There
are a couple of user stories we used to get moving.

The product owner who wrote the stories is a little inexperienced and needs a bit
of help.

## Story One

> As a participant
>
> I want to be able to log on to the product
>
> So that I can access valuable content

:heavy_check_mark: Participant can log on with user name and password

# Story Two

> As a participant
>
> I want to be able to access an exercise
>
> So that I can learn a new skill

:heavy_check_mark: Content all renders correctly

## Approach

Through this exercise we're looking for:

* Tooling selection that complements our [existing stack](https://stackshare.io/mind-gym/mind-gym)
* Excellent code in your most comfortable area of the stack.
* Proficiency in the areas where you are less comfortable.
* The same quality engineering practices you use in your day job.
* Great communication. You will be interacting with individuals of diverse skill levels.

We will share a link and credentials at the start of the exercise

Feel free to use the Internet (Google, Travis or libraries / frameworks etc...) Whatever makes your life easier.
