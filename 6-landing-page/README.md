# Landing Page

## Background

We are using an external agency to define our brand. We are in the early stages
but we're working together and have a lightweight style guide. We'd like to see
how this might look on a coded landing page for some user testing.

* Excellent code in your most comfortable area of the stack.
* Proficiency in the areas where you are less comfortable.
* The same quality engineering practices you use in your day job.
* Great communication. You will be interacting with individuals of diverse skill levels.

Feel free to use the Internet (Google, Travis or libraries / frameworks etc...) Whatever makes your life easier.
