# Landing Page

## Background

We are using an external agency to define our brand. We are in the early stages
but we're working together and have a lightweight style guide. We'd like to see
how this might look on a coded landing page for some user testing.

# The Font

Is **Gotham**. All materials use Gotham Pro in three weights. Gotham Pro is a
versatile, geometric sans serif typeface. Its bold weights work perfectly with
our bold diagrams and photography, and the lighter versions present our copy
legibly and unpretentiously. Gotham’s square cut design harmonises with our use
of line.

## Break It Up

Do not use Zest Green directly next to an accent colour. Cunningly deploy an
element of Blackboard Grey, Mist Grey or White to seperate them and mediate the
relationship.

- ![#2cd649](https://via.placeholder.com/15/2cd649/000000?text=+) `#2cd649` Zest Green

## The Foundations

All primary colours balance perfectly with Zest Green and with each other. Our
cool and commanding primary palette should form the backbone of all designs, with
Zest Green always incorporated in inventive ways.

- ![#ffffff](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ffffff/000000?text=+) `#ffffff` White

- ![#f0f2f5](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f0f2f5/000000?text=+) `#f0f2f5` Mist Grey

- ![#3a3a3e](https://via.placeholder.com/15/3a3a3e/000000?text=+) `#3a3a3e` Blackboard Grey

## The Specialists

Eigengrau and Marengo should be used only when necessary to differentiate data
or to provide contrast within diagrams, illustrations and infographics. Never
use them for backgrounds or type.

- ![#5c5c61](https://via.placeholder.com/15/5c5c61/000000?text=+) `#5c5c61` Marengo

- ![#16161d](https://via.placeholder.com/15/16161d/000000?text=+) `#16161d` Eigengrau

## The Finishing Touch

Accent colours should be used sparingly, to emphasise specific details. Accent
colours should never be used for type, or as colour-coding. Only one accent colour
should ever be

- ![#24bec6](https://via.placeholder.com/15/24bec6/000000?text=+) `#24bec6` Turquoise

- ![#7978c7](https://via.placeholder.com/15/7978c7/000000?text=+) `#7978c7` Amethyst

- ![#23a0f4](https://via.placeholder.com/15/23a0f4/000000?text=+) `#23a0f4` Cobalt

- ![#f8655b](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f8655b/000000?text=+) `#f8655b` Coral

- ![#f9a600](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f9a600/000000?text=+) `#f9a600` Gold

## Image Personalities

- **Scenes** - A selection of evocative, symbolic and theatrical settings to
create a sense of atmosphere when used with copy.

- **Animals** - Animals provide the ultimate anthropomorphic metaphor. Look for
human-like qualities and otherworldly photography.

- **Archival** - Used appropriately, archival images can be a wonderfully original
way to look at a subject through the lens of history.

- **People** - Never use staged photos. Look for people out in the real world,
doing real things, from angles that put you in the moment.

- **Still Life** - Look for interesting, close cropped compositions. One object
at a time, and make sure they’re interesting.
